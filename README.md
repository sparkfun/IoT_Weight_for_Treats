IoT_Weight_for_Treats
=====================

Code used for the IoT series ("Fellowship of the Things") episode 2.

Copy the code into the [particle.io](https://www.particle.io/) IDE. Run the calibration code first in order to get the magic "calibration factor" number. Paste that number into the "weight-for-treats" code. Finally, upload that program to the Photon.

Upon sensing 1 lb or greater, the servo will actuate to dispense some treats. While the dog munches on those (after a 2 second delay), the Photon posts the weight to [https://data.sparkfun.com/sfe_dogs](https://data.sparkfun.com/sfe_dogs).

The code is beerware; if you see me (or any other SparkFun employee) at the local, and you've found our code helpful, please buy us a round!
